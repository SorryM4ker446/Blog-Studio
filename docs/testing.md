# Automated Testing

Blog Studio uses an isolated PostgreSQL database for integration and browser tests. Test tooling refuses to connect unless the configured database name ends in `_test`.

## Test database

Create a dedicated database such as `blog_db_test`. Never point `TEST_DB_DSN` at the development database `blog_db`.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:TEST_DB_DSN = "host=localhost user=postgres password=your_password dbname=blog_db_test port=5432 sslmode=disable TimeZone=Asia/Shanghai"
```

The integration test helper validates the database name before running `TRUNCATE`. The Playwright setup resets this isolated database and creates a test-only administrator before every run.

## Backend tests

Run all Go tests:

```powershell
cd backend
go test ./...
```

Run the integration tests with detailed output:

```powershell
go test -v ./internal/routes
```

When `TEST_DB_DSN` is absent, PostgreSQL integration tests are skipped. CI always supplies it, so the integration tests are mandatory there.

## Browser workflow test

Install the Chromium browser once:

```powershell
cd frontend
npx playwright install chromium
```

Run the E2E workflow:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright starts isolated backend and frontend servers on ports `18080` and `3100`. The test covers login, draft creation, public draft isolation, publishing, public visibility, logout, and protected-editor redirection.

On failure, inspect `frontend/test-results` or open the saved trace:

```powershell
npx playwright show-trace test-results/<result-directory>/trace.zip
```

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions creates a disposable `blog_db_test` PostgreSQL service. The backend job runs the Go integration tests, while the E2E job installs Chromium and runs the Playwright workflow. Failure screenshots, video, trace, and HTML reports are retained as workflow artifacts for seven days.
